# 7days15apps🔥

Welcome to **7days15apps**!
This repository is a showcase of 15 projects I built in just 7 days, while juggling my work as an Android Programmer, surviving lecture quiz week, and organizing an upcoming event at the Google Developer Groups on Campus (Binus University Online).


## About

**Why did I do this?**  
I challenged myself to rapidly build a diverse set of applications to sharpen my skills, push my creativity, and prove that with determination (and a bit of caffeine), you can achieve amazing things—even when life gets busy!
